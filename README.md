Hello, I'm Mapniv. Want to learn something about me? Read on.

### Background:
- Nationality: Polish
- Age: Young adult

## My story with technology
### Childhood and primary school
- As a child I had no computer
- At primary school I enjoyed a program where you had to write some commands
 for a wizard to do. You could move the wizard, place blocks etc.
### Gymnasium
- In Gymnasium I had my first contact with HTML
- Some time later me and my siblings got a laptop. I installed
 Code::Blocks and started learning C++
- Later I switched to C, if I recall correctly it was because C is faster
- At some point the laptop broke, I forgot about programming for a while
- I got a tablet at some point and was programming on it. Pain
- I graduated gymnasium with good grades, and it was time to choose middle 
 school profile. I chose math-phisics-IT because I liked math
- During holidays my mother died from cancer, I was 16 or 17 back then
- Someone who also had diffifult childhood when they were young decided to 
 help me. They started sending me 300 PLN a month until the graduation
### Middle school
- First year of middle school: We were learning programming. Everyone was 
 using C++ except for me, I was using C. I tried to optimize everything. 
 The teacher once told me that during exam no one will care how fast is my 
 program, they only thing they will care about is whether it works
- Before holidays began I had enought money to buy a new laptop. It costed 
 1600 PLN and had 2 core processor, 8 GB RAM and 240 GB SSD. It had no OS. 
 During a lesson I asked IT teacher whether I could download Linux. They 
 agreed and I burned it to a CD. Yes, CD, I had no idea how big Linux was.
 I used a netinstall Ubuntu version as it was less than 300MB. When I 
 returned home I proceeded to install Ubuntu. I was follwoing the tutorial 
 on my tablet. Everything worked except wifi, I couldn't connect to a 
 network. Little did I know that at the time my laptop wasn't fully 
 supported by Linux. I connected to wifi using my tablet and used USB
 tethering. Then I finished the installation. I used this approach whenever 
 I needed to install something
- Second year of middle school: We were learning Excel, I was pretty good at 
 it. However I couldn't train at home as I had no Windows machine
- At some point wifi was fixed. I could use my laptop normally
- Third year of middle school: We were learning Access, again I couldn't 
 train at home. Everyone but me used GUI to work with databases. I was 
 writing SQL code. I found GUI approach confusing (perhaps that was an omen)
- I couldn't finish any Access task on time and couldn't finish it at 
 home so I almost got a failing grade, however teacher seeing that I was
 actually doing something (unlike other students) gave me an additional mark 
 so I didn't fail in the end.
- Covid started and with it remote learning (hated it)
- Final exam: I scored 40% and that was more than 75% of the people taking 
 the exam. Unfortunatelly I got no points for Excel problem as I wrote that
 the answer was saved in a .xls file while it had a .xlsx extension
### Adulthood
- Enrolled at local university of technology, initially there were no remote 
 learning but when it changed I intentionally failed the first semester
- Ran vim for the first time, closed the terminal as I couldn't quit it
- In 2021 standatd support for Ubuntu 16.04 ended. I decided to try Arch
- Due to a kernel panic I switched back to Ubuntu, this time 18.04
- Read an article about vim+tmux combo, started using neovim, 
 I didn't use tmux as I didn't like the key bindings
- Another kernel bug, decided to abandon Ubuntu, found Void Linux 
 Decided to go for a manual install. Installed Openbox with custom
 configuration, configured URxvt to look like normal terminal
- Installed and configured tmux
- Discovered that Lua table indexes start at one :(
- Discovered Haskell, first language that managed to impress me
- Decided to write my own embeddable scripting language with arrays 
 starting at zero and syntax inspired by Haskell
